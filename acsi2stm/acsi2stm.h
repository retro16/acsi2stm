// SD card write lock pin behavior (PB0, PB1 and PB3-PB5).
// In every case, soldering these pins to VCC (+3.3V) will disable the SD slot
// and free the corresponding ACSI id on the bus.
//
// This #define indicates how the pin behaves when connected to the SD card
// reader's "write lock" pin.
// If set to 0: the pin is completely ignored, the SD card is always writable
// If set to 1: the pin is floating when read-write, tied to GND when read-only

// Push data faster in DMA transfers
// Setting to non-zero unrolls the DMA transfer code but may be less compatible
// with some ST DMA controllers.
//
// Values 1 to 5 select different algorithms, from the most conservative to the
// fastest. It seems that the STM32 has hardware glitches in some corner cases,
// and different algorithms do different tradeoffs for speed and compatibility.
// The main issue is STM32 flash being too slow for DMA, now all DMA uploads are
// done from STM32 RAM to make sure data is correct.
//
// Algorithms apply to STM32->ST transfers, for ST->STM32 any non-zero value
// will enable fast DMA.
#define ACSI_FAST_DMA 5

// Adds an additional delay between the last command byte received and the
// beginning of a DMA transfer. There is an inherent write hole in the ST and
// if unlucky enough a bus lock can happen, delaying the time between the CPU
// sending the last command byte and the CPU actually turning DMA on.
// The code supposes that an SD card operation is always long enough so this
// delay is only applied for write operations or synthesized replies.
// Delay in microseconds.

// Stack canary
// Used to check that RAM was not overwritten. Set to 0 for normal operation,
// or a size in bytes to enable the feature.
// If more than 75% of this amount of stack is used, debug messages will be

// Automatically disabled if ACSI_DEBUG is disabled.
#define ACSI_STACK_CANARY 3072

// If set, fakes firmware update

// Don't use DMA at all, use programmed input/output instead (A1/CS/IRQ)
// This is a workaround for dead DMA chips (a common issue on STs).
// Only GemDrive will work, and you can't self-boot it, you need to use
// GEMDRPIO.TOS to start it.
