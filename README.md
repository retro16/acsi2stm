ACSI2STM: Atari ST ACSI hard drive emulator
===========================================

This code provides a hard drive emulator for your Atari ST using an inexpensive
STM32 microcontroller and a SD card.

The aim of this project is to be very easy to build, extremely cheap, reliable
and safe for your precious vintage machine.

The module supports up to 5 SD card readers, showing them as 5 different ACSI
devices plugged in.

It can work in 2 ways:
 * Expose a raw SD card as a hard disk to the Atari.
 * Expose a floppy or hard disk image file on a standard SD card to the Atari.

It also provides an UltraSatan compatible real-time clock if you add a simple 3V
lithium battery.

**WARNING**, the pinout has changed for version 3.xx. If you built or bought a
unit for older firmware, you need to make changes. See the last section of
[hardware.md](doc/hardware.md) for more information.


Documentation
-------------

The *doc* directory provides documentation for the end-user as well as hardware
implementors or curious people.

This is what you can find:

 * [manual.md](doc/manual.md): A brief user manual for people owning a unit.
 * [a2setup.md](doc/a2setup.md): User manual for the ACSI2STM setup tool.
 * [pcb_manual.md](doc/pcb_manual.md): User manual for the official PCB.
 * [compiling.md](doc/compiling.md): A step-by-step tutorial to compile and
   upload a new firmware. Also includes how to customize the firmware for
   non-developers by changing compile-time options.
 * [build_pcb.md](doc/build_pcb.md): Instructions for building an unit using
   the official PCB.
 * [hardware.md](doc/hardware.md): How to build an acsi2stm unit from scratch.
 * [debug_output.txt](doc/debug_output.txt): A sample output of the logs you
   should get when booting a SD card.
 * [troubleshooting.md](doc/troubleshooting.md): Having problems? Have a look
   in here.


To people buying/selling hardware
---------------------------------

There are people building and selling products based on this code. This project
is not directly related to any of these people, there is no official hardware
supplier.

Building and selling units is encouraged, as long as the spirit of free software
is preserved and the terms of the license are respected.

The code here is released under the GPLv3 license (see LICENSE file). This has
some implications:

 * If you bought a product that contains code based on this project (modified or
   not), you can request the source code to the firmware contained in your
   product. The seller/maker of the product is legally required to provide it.
 * If you sell any product based on this code, you **must** provide a link to
   the source.
 * If you sell any product based on a modified version of this code, or reusing
   parts of this code, you **must** provide a link to the whole source code of
   the modified version with the product, including any additional
   features/modules you may have added.
 * If you redistribute binary versions (modified or not), you **must** provide a
   link to the source code matching exactly the binary you redistribute.
 * Any modified version must retain the GPLv3 or a compatible license.
 * The name ACSI2STM is not protected. You can reuse it as you wish. Making a
   clear distinction between this code and your product will be greatly
   appreciated (most sellers do).

   on various forums.
 * The Hatari developpers. I used its source code as a reference for ACSI
   commands.
