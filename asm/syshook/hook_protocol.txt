The following commands set DMA read operations on the stack, right after the stack return pointer (CPU dependant)
This offset cannot be fetched again, so make sure you read all parameters before playing with the DMA address
0x0e: GEMDOS hook
0x0f: BIOS hook
0x10: XBIOS hook


Reply format:
$8d: forward hook to system
$8c [4x byte]: Set D0 and return from exception
$8a [4x byte]: Set D0 and return from subroutine
$88 [4x byte]: Call pexec(4, 0, param, 0) then return from exception
$86 [4x byte]: Call pexec(6, 0, param, 0) then return from exception
$85 [4x byte]: execute 4 bytes as machine code, set DMA read on the stack then wait for another reply byte
$84 [4x byte]: execute 4 bytes as machine code, set DMA write on the stack then wait for another reply byte
$83 [4x byte]: set DMA read at address and wait for another reply byte
$82 [4x byte]: set DMA write at address and wait for another reply byte
$81 [4x byte]: read byte count from stack (word), and copy [byte count + 1] bytes from stack to address. set DMA read on stack data. sp unchanged
$80 [4x byte]: read byte count from stack (word), and copy [byte count + 1] bytes from address to stack. set DMA write on stack data. sp unchanged

Notes:
 * For non-returning commands, the ST signals that the operation is completed by sending a dummy command byte
 * All command bytes (both sending and receiving) are transfered in "fast" mode: the ST doesn't wait for the ACK signal at all. The STM32 is fast enough to handle this in all cases.
